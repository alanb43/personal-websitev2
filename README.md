# Second iteration of my personal website

First iteration (static html/css) [is on my github](https://github.com/alanb43/personal-website), modelling an Amazon listing for myself as a SWE intern.

This iteration will likely be a twitter mock where I can post things to the main page as I do them, and maybe I'll even let select people have accounts and post about their experiences working with me or things like this. Not currently building this out, just in the idea phase. Want to build something cool and make it client-side and server-side dynamic, so gonna be using Flask and SQLite backend with a React.js frontend I think.

If you're here looking at the github page for this project, thank you! If you're a student or developer who wants to work on something small or big, please email me (ab43work@gmail.com)
